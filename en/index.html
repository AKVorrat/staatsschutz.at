		<h2>9 important facts about<br> the new State Protection Act</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Austria gets a new secret service.
			<li>The Federal Agency for State Protection and Counter Terrorism (<abbr title="Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz und TerrorismusbekÃ¤mpfung">BVT</abbr>), which is currently a police department, will soon gain the powers of an intelligence agency.
			<li>The <abbr>BVT</abbr> will be able to spy on any citizens without having to ask for a permit from a judge or prosecutor.
			<li>To <q> estimate the possibility</q> of an "attack endangering the constitution" everyone can be spied upon. Only a justified suspicion of danger is required. However, there are no clear rules on where and how the justification for the existence of a concrete danger has to be recorded in writing and must be submitted.
			<li>The <abbr>BVT</abbr> can access the data from all authorities and all companies, no judge or prosecutor is needed. The only control instance is the internal officer for the protection of rights of the <abbr>Ministry of the Interior (BMI)</abbr> and the <abbr>BVT</abbr> has the possibility to deny him access to files for various reasons, for example in order to protect the identity of a witness.
			<li>The objectives of the <abbr>BVT</abbr> are many more than just the defense against terrorism. People acting as whistleblowers, people protesting against right-wing extremists in the Hofburg, or protestors against animal cruelty become the target of authority
			<li>Around 100 crimes are defined as <q>attack endangering the constitution</q>, 40 of them if they are committed with <q>religious or ideological motives</q>.
			<li>The <abbr>BVT</abbr> may store all the data for 6 years. Who is accessing this data is stored only for 3 years.
			<li>Austria will soon have 10 new intelligence agencies, because in addition to the <abbr>BVT</abbr> also all 9 provinces get their own office with the same powers. Each Governor will soon have his own intelligence agency.

		<h2>Our 5 demands</h2>
		<p>The signatories to this petition call on the Austrian Government and the National Council to fulfill the following five points concerning the planned State Protection Act.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><span class="demand_short">Fact-based protection policy</span> - The State Protection Act needs to return to square one. It has to be reoriented after a comprehensive evaluation of the monitoring situation, determining statistics about investigations, and an evidence-based survey of security needs. Before the federal government may restrict basic rights, it must prove that their project is necessary and proportionate.</li>
				<li><span class="demand_short">Clear separation of police and intelligence services</span> - The State Security must not be a part of the police and at the same time possess the same surveillance rights as a secret agency. Clear responsibilities are needed.</li>
				<li><span class="demand_short">No repression against civil society, journalists, and "whistleblowers"</span> - The responsibility/duty of the state security shouldn't be to act on easily constructed low level/minor offenses. The "attack endangering the constitution" must only encompass the most serious crimes and must not restrict general fundamental rights such as the right to demonstrate or freedom of the press.</li>
				<li><span class="demand_short">Strong legal protection, no "pre-crime"</span> - for each surveillance measure concrete suspicions and the proportionality of the interference must be justified in written form and approved judicially. Parliamentary control must be enhanced and the transparency of the activities of the security authorities must be strengthened.</li>
				<li><span class="demand_short">No paid spies</span> - Examples in and outside of Austria show that the use of "trusted third parties" in legal processes often leads to difficulties - and paid spies often lead to scandalous excesses. Austria should learn from the experiences of other countries instead of repeating their mistakes. The use of unpaid "undercover agents" (spies) should be clearly regulated in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code.</li>

	<div class="sectionimage">
		<img src=".././img/examples.png" alt="examples">
	</div>
	<section class="indent paper">
		<h2 class="nocss">2 examples</h2>

		<h2>Example 1: Abolition of press freedom</h2>
		<p>
			In our comment, we show on basis of the dispute around the  <abbr>ORF (Austrian broadcast company) </abbr> documentary 
			<q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jpfJ70SmL8">Am Schauplatz â€“ am rechten Rand</a></q> how the new State Protection Act adversely affects editorial secrecy. The editor of <abbr>ORF</abbr> documentation was accused of having incited teenagers to National Socialist Offences, which then led to the seizure of footage from the <abbr>ORF</abbr> archive.
			</p>
			<p>
			The court order to surrender the material was later decided to be fundamentally unlawful by <abbr title="Oberster Gerichtshof">the Austrian Supreme Court (OGH).</abbr>
			Among the new investigative powers included in the PStSG <q>strong suspicion</q> as now required by the Criminal Procedure Code is no longer a prerequisite for the use of instruments such as covert investigation, monitoring of communication, data synchronization, and many more.
			</p>
			<p>
			In future, even the <q>evaluation of the likelihood</q> of a threat is sufficient to undermine the editorial secret and other recognized professional secrets even without direct confiscation.A comparable legal process, with which the <abbr>ORF</abbr> editorial staff at that time prohibited the breakdown of editorial secrecy, would not be availiable after the introduction of the proposed law. It might even be possible that journalists would not be notified about the breach of their secrets in the course of the actions of the state authorities.
		</p>

		<h2>Example 2: database for "potentially dangerous citizens"</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.juridikum.at/fileadmin/user_upload/ausgaben/juridikum_4-2011.pdf">The Students' Union organized a bus trip to a political event</a> (PDF, page 417). On their Departure Point a police squad was waiting for them. The police did not let students who did not show their IDs and let the police search their luggage enter the bus. Some people were undergoing this procedure. Later they filed a complaint for violation of their individual rights and the court declared the identity verification and inspection unlawful.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the police acted illegally, their collected data could end up in a database of <q>potentially dangerous citizens</q>. 
In this new database introduced through the state protection act various sensitive informations are stored (e.g. sexual orientation, union membership) to rate the possibility of an "attack endangering the constitution"
			</p>
			<p> 
			These data are stored for up to six years, ten times longer than it was the case with the data retention in Austria. 
Furthermore, they can be legaly exchanged with foreign intelligence services as NSA, GCHQ and BND. The logs about who accessed this database are only stored for 3 years, which is certainly not helpful in preventing abuse of these highly sensitive data.

	<section class="indent paper">
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>State protection instead of Constitutional Protection:</strong>
			In the draft of the law, the state is defined only as the sum of the state institutions which have to be protected.

The protection of the constitution and the fundamental rights of the population are no longer part of the scope of the
			<abbr title="Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz und TerrorismusbekÃ¤mpfung">BVT</abbr>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Potential for abuse because of redundancies:</strong> The Federal Office and the federal offices will continue to be security agencies, they will mostly use <abbr title="Sicherheitspolizeigesetz">SPG</abbr> and in specific cases <abbr title="Polizeiliches Staatsschutzgesetz">PStSG</abbr>
			. One single authority may thus act on the basis of different laws. An official can choose whether he needs to get a judge's permission to demand telecommunications data from an internet service provider or not. 
For example, once a <q>religious or ideological motivation</q> is assumed in an offense, the legal protection can be bypassed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Extended threat research for <q>attacks endangering the constitution</q>:</strong> The concept of an <q>attack endangering the constitution</q> is a very important key aspect in this law. It determines the scope of action and competences of <q>State security bodies</q>. Apart from a very vague definition of what is meant by it, authorities can already respond to <q>probable attacks endangering the constitution</q> before they started using all of their surveillance powers to store all potential suspects in their database. So they are allowed to collect <q>any information from all available sources</q> - which also includes publicly accessible data on the internet about when a person <q>probably</q> would like to take part in a demonstration against the academics ball for example.
			
			To put it plainly, those who <q>probably</q> want to participate in the prevention or disruption of a meeting such as this ball have to fear systematic monitoring by the <abbr>BVT</abbr>, before even attending the demonstration. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Far-reaching opportunities for data collection and processing: </strong> The collection of personal data of suspects and their contact persons will be allowed for <q>assessment of the likelihood of a hazard</q> in the future. This means that a concrete suspicion is not explicitly needed. As a result, the entire internet usage of a target person can be collected and evaluated. Most means of (undercover) investigation are therefore no longer linked to specific crimes or suspicious circumstances. It suffices if authorities want to analyze an abstract risk scenario. This comprehensive collection of data on potentially everyone of us may be stored for 5 years and logs about who is accessing these data get deleted after 3 years.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Numerous technical surveillance possibilities:</strong> The use of tracking devices and
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher"><abbr>IMSI</abbr>-<span lang="en">catchers</span></a> will be permitted,
			<q>if the observation was otherwise difficult or considered hopeless</q>. The periods for the permitted use of such special investigative means will be increased. According to the old law of the <abbr title="StPO/Strafprozessordnung">Code of Criminal Procedure</abbr>, the maximum period is three months under the condition of a court order. Under the new legal system of <abbr title="Polizeiliches Staatsschutzgesetz">PStSG</abbr>even six months are possible, and all it takes to prolong the observation is the approval of the officer for the protection of rights at the Interior Ministry. In the same way, the protection of the citizens' rights against audio and video recordings during surveillance by the police, the analysis of travel movements <abbr title="Passenger Name Records">(PNR)</abbr>, and information regarding traffic and content data from the Internet is withdrawn.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Paid informers:</strong> The legalization of paid undercover agents without judicial review is also extremely problematic. The current draft of the law shows very little sensitivity to issues such as the entrapment, and it draws no lessons from the huge scandal involving the 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Underground"><abbr title="National Socialist Underground">NSU</abbr>murders</a> in Germany.

			<strong>Missing evaluation:</strong> The draft of the new <abbr>PStSG</abbr> includes a chapter with a promising title - the <q>impact-oriented consequence assessment</q>,
			but here only to budgetary implications are evaluated. 

There are neither statistics explaining which surveillance measures have proven to be effective so far and why there is a need to extended them, nor are there criteria defined, such as security situation or increased rate of solved crimes, on which the impact of the reform can be measured.  In its <span lang="en">Project HEAT</span>, the <abbr>AK Vorrat</abbr> demands a full evaluation of all anti-terror laws in Austria and is supplying the scientific basis.

			<strong>Police and intelligence services in one Authority:</strong> Due to the extremely vague definition of an <q>attack endangering the constitution</q> and the expansion of surveillance powers to the <q>evaluation of the likelihood of a threat</q> , a police force with the powers of an intelligence service is created. 
The principle of mandatory prosecution of offenses and the principle of opportunity are being breached. The <abbr>BVT</abbr> and - even worse - the federal offices become uncontrollable authorities with officials who are subject to almost no limits in their operations and don't have to answer to anyone. The next police scandal in <abbr>BVT</abbr> is inevitable.

			<h2 class="nocss">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				With the vague definition of <q>attack endangering the constitution</q>, the law creates the basis for the excessive surveillance of innocent citizens. Although such serious intrusions into privacy require careful control, no efficient legal mechanisms have been provided. 
A feigned reason justifies the means. 
According to the AKVorrat, the bill creates the basis for a domestic intelligence agency and therefore it is rejected entirely. At the same time AKVorrat acknowledges that counter-terrorism measures are needed. This, however, should be drafted in an open dialogue with stakeholders and evaluated very closely in terms of effectiveness and with respect for fundamental rights.
